The issue of managing uniforms requires registration/homeroom teachers to record pupils who lack uniform. 

As a registration teacher, this takes up a lot of my time as it requires checking around the classroom and then sending an email to the appropriate person within the school. The person who receives all these emails then has to collate that information and then send emails or texts home about this. 

This system is designed to simplify that process and make it more streamlined.

In a nutshell, this system:
- Allows registration/homeroom teachers to quickly mark each pupil without uniform
- Allows the person who is receiving the data to process it much quicker
